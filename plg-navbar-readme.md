#kirby-site-snippets: plg-navbar and plg-navbar-level*

## how to use
There are three version of the navbar snippet. One "normal" navbar ant two for different levels.
The normal navbar displays everything from root level, but sometimes there is a navbar needed, which displayes all site beginning at level 2 or 3 - e.g. for a site with several quite independent sections.


### prerequisites:
(Twitter) Bootstrap included in your template. With everything for a navbar enabled.

The snippet code itself must be placed in the `site/snippets` folder. Of course you can add them in a subdirectory if this folder. (Especially useful if you use git submodules.)


### additional code to put in your snippets/ templates:


#### in your config
```php
// twitter bootstap navbar color class
c::set('navbar-class', 'navbar-default');
c::set('navbar-affix', true); //needs some boostrap script!
// c::set('navbar-ignoreChildren', true); //disable dropdowns for children pages
```
Set the navbar class you want (toggles style and position). See the [boostrap docs](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar) for more info.
If you have content above your navbar and want your navbar affixed when scrolling down, set `navbar-addix`. But keep a look at <http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#affix>.
Additionally you can disable the dropdown menus for child pages.

By default the navbar does only display visible pages.

#### before you closing body tag
```php
<?php if (c::get('navbar-affix')) : ?>
  <script>
    $('.navbar-wrapper').affix({
          offset: {
            top: $('header').height()
          }
    });
  </script>
<?php endif; ?>
```


### usage:
If eveythig is set up, including the snippet in your template is quite easy. Simple put
```php
snippet('plg-navbar');
```
in your template code, or
```php
snippet('plg-navbar-level3');
```
for a navbar at level 3.
Of course this must be somewhere between php-tags, so that php interprets this code.

#### navbar-level-2
Currently there are some additional features for the navbar at level 2. I really need to maintain these plugins more often!

You can specify that all pages should be displayed, not only the visible ones. Add `invisible=>true` to the options array.

Another feature is to have your logo as the root link, but also another button for the home-page of your level 2 section. So you have your normal home page at root, but also a home page at level 1 which is the root of the level 2 pages this navbar displayes.
You can enable this by setting `sub_home=>true`.

So the code to add is something like this:
```php
snippet('plg-navbar-level2', array('invisible'=>false, 'sub_home'=>false));
```
